## Problem

Thousands of Ukrainian refugees arrive to Hungary every day, who are seeking help (food, accommodation, administration and other services). 
The charities need more helping hands, but they don't have a common platform where they could reach volunteers. 
On the other hand there are a lot of people who would like to help but they don't know how to do it in a legal and organized way. 

## Our solution

# pin - people in need

**Where charity meets people**

We have created a concept for a mobile application (Android and iOS) which brings the two sides (volunteers and charities) together to make collaborations faster and easier.
**What is a pin?** A pin is basically an event organized by a charity for which volunteers can register. 

## Features

Charities can:
- create account
- create pins with settings like category, location, date/time,  required number of volunteers
- track the number of volunteers for every pin
- view the profiles of the registered volunteers for the event
- contact the applicants

Volunteers can:
- create account
- create a profile page and set preferences
- browse pins
- search for pins based on several criteria (location, interest, date/time)
- register for pins as a volunteer
- receive push notifications about interesting pins

Future feature plans: 
- create a chat group for pins so that charities and volunteers can easily keep in touch and discuss the details
- flag system: irresponsible volunteers could be marked by charities
- gamification (eg. collect points for pins)
